** ls_generic are created for the profiles where data were not good enough to read,,,,,,
** Artificially PVs are used for 55% PV penetration study in STM Campus. In real scenario 33% PV penetration is available.,,,,,,
** some transformers have no load or some loads are artificially provided due to some of them are under construction,,,,,,
** Meter data for a building are taken and divided among the transformers of the building,,,,,,
"** peak PV generation is occuring during May. So, May data is considered for simulation",,,,,,
*** Existi ng PV generation  is also increased by multipliers,,,,,,
"***URBANopt will only export data to absolute loads, it will not write normalized loads",,,,,,
***We will hold normalized loads constant between real and simulated data,,,,,,
