If you send the resulting file to someone they will also need access to that weather file at the expected location. The design day and water main information is save within the OSM. The \"Weather File Name\" argument expects the path to an epw. The measure expects a .ddy and optionally a .stat file of the same name. Since this measure uses a string argument to represent a path to a file, it won't run correctly for cloud simulations.",
