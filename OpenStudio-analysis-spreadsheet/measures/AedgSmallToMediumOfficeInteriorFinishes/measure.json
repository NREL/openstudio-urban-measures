  "modeler_description_xml": "While the AEDG guide recommends unique wall reflectance targets above and below 7', the measure will use the 7' target on all interior walls. Cost was not included as part of this measure as there likely isn't a significant cost impact to lighter finishes. This measure will treat interior partition surfaces as furniture. The measure will only enhance reflectance. If a material already exceeds the target it will be left alone. Optionally you can also lower selected interior partition surfaces to 36\".",
  "description_xml": "This measure will adjust the visible reflectance of materials used on interior building surfaces. Different target values will be set for floors, ceilings, and furniture/interior partition surfaces."
