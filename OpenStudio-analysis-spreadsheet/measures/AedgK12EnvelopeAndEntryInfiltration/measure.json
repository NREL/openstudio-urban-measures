  "modeler_description_xml": "This measure will remove all existing infiltration objects and then add two new types of objects. Every zone will get an infiltration object that adds infiltration per area of exterior envelope. Zones in a user specified floor will have an extra infiltration object specific to occupant entry and exit to and from the building. The measure allows you to pick a baseline or low energy recommendation for envelope infiltration. Additionally there is a choice argument to model the building entry with or without vestibules. The measure will pick the recommended value by looking at the model's climate zone and size, but the user can override this recommendation.",
  "description_xml": "This measure addresses two sources of air infiltration. The first is infiltration through the building envelope. The second is infiltration due to occupants entering and leaving the building. The AEDG provides recommendations and tips on how to limit infiltration in both cases. For occupant entry vestibules may be recommended at major entries depending on the size of the building and climate zone."
