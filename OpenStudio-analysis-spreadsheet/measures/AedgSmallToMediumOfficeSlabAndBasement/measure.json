  "modeler_description_xml": "This measure doesn't change the constructions in the model, rather it runs the EnergyPlus slab or basement pre-processor to calculate monthly ground temperatures given inputs for constructions soil properties, and additional model information. It will also adjust the boundary condition of ground exposed surfaces.",
  "description_xml": "This measure applies Small to Medium Office AEDG 50% recommendations for slab and below grade walls. It can also be used to model and simulate ASHRAE 90.1 2004 slab and below grade wall insulation levels. Note that for many climate zones (1-3), if your model doesn't have below grade walls or heated slabs the AEDG recommendations will be the same as the ASHRAE 90.1 20004 baseline. This measure runs a multi-year simulation so it will take a few minutes to run."
