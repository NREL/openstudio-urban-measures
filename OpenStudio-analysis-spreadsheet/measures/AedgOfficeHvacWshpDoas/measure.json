  "modeler_description_xml": "Airloops are dedicated to ventilation (DOAS) and have constant speed fan operation, gas furnace heating, and single speed DX cooling.  Conditioning is provided at the zone level with water sourced heat pumps with cycling fans.  The heat pumps are connected to a plant loop supplied by a boiler and cooling tower.  The heat pump loop floats between 20 C and 30 C.",
  "description_xml": "Measure replaces existing HVAC system (if any) with a Water Source Heat Pump (WSHP) with DOAS HVAC system (one DOAS per floor).  The WSHP with DOAS system (centralized DOAS, with zone level conditioning) is applied to all space types.  In select cases, the user is given the option to preserve existing HVAC schedules.  In other cases, new schedules are generated that align with AEDG recommendations.  The resulting HVAC system reflects the HVAC recommendations of the 50% Small and Medium Office AEDG."
