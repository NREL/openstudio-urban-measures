It has building level information as well as detail on space types, thermal zones, HVAC systems, envelope characteristics, and economics. Click the heading above a chart to view a table of the chart data.",
  "modeler_description": "For the most part consumption data comes from the tabular EnergyPlus results, however there are a few requests added for time series results. Space type and loop details come from the OpenStudio model. The code for this is modular, making it easy to use as a template for your own custom reports. The structure of the report uses bootstrap, and the graphs use dimple js.",
