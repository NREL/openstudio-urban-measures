  "modeler_description_xml": "Airloops are dedicated to ventilation (DOAS) and have variable speed fan operation and hot and chilled water coils.  Chiller for DOAS is air-cooled.  Conditioning is provided at the zone level with water sourced heat pumps with cycling fans.  The heat pumps are connected to a plant loop supplied by district heating and cooling.  The district heating and cooling approximate the performance of a (optimally-sized) ground loop.  The heat pump loop floats between 5 C and 21 C.  Currently, district heating and cooling energy is not removed from EnergyPlus results.  Packaged single zone systems have constant speed fan operation, gas furnace heating, and single speed DX cooling.",
  "description_xml": "Measure replaces existing HVAC system (if any) with a Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) with DOAS HVAC system (one DOAS per floor).  The GSHP with DOAS system (centralized DOAS, with zone level conditioning) is applied to all space types except Cafeteria, Kitchen, Gym, and Auditorium; packaged single zone equipment is applied to those zones.  In select cases, the user is given the option to preserve existing HVAC schedules.  In other cases, new schedules are generated that align with AEDG recommendations.  The resulting HVAC system reflects the HVAC recommendations of the 50% K-12 AEDG."
